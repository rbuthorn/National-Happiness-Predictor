# National Happiness Data Analysis and Predictor

## Project Description
This program aims to perform data analysis on the relationships between features given in the datasets shown above. Each country represents a row in the database, and each feature is a column. These features include happiness score, GDP/capita, life expectancy, freedom level, and a few others. Additionally, after performing a thorough analysis of the relationships between these features and their respective countries, we created 3 machine learning models which aim to predict a country's happiness score based on the features present in the data. These models include a linear regression, a ridge regression and a decision tree regression. We were able to obtain a MSE (mean squared error) of .28 on our best model.
